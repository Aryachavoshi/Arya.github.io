I am a Research Assistant Professor of [Electrical and Systems Engeneering (ESE)](https://ese.wustl.edu/Pages/default.aspx) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu), and member of the [PhD in Imaging Science Faculty](https://engineering.wustl.edu/departments-faculty/interdisciplinary-degree-programs/imaging-science/Pages/default.aspx).<br>
Prior to joining Washington University, I was a Research Associate at The Institute for [Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](http://ices.utexas.edu/) of [The University of Texas at Austin](http://utexas.edu/) (March 2015-July 2018), working with [Prof. Omar Ghattas](http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~omar) on scalable numerical methods for the solution of Bayesian inverse problems, uncertainty quantification and propagation, optimal experimental design, and optimization under uncertainty.<br>
I completed my postdoctoral training at the [Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC)](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/) of [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)](https://llnl.gov/) (February 2013 - February 2015), working with [Dr. Panayot Vassilevski](http://people.llnl.gov/vassilevski1) on algebraic multigrid and numerical upscaling techniques with applications to flow in porous media.<br>
In December 2012, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics with specialization in Computational Mathematics (high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, image processing,
inverse problems, and numerical analysis) from [Emory University](http://emory.edu/), with [Prof. Alessandro Veneziani](http://mathcs.emory.edu/~ale)
([Dept. of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/)) serving as my principal advisor.
