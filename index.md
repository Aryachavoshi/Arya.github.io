I am currently a Research Associate at [The Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](http://ices.utexas.edu/) of [The University of Texas at Austin](http://utexas.edu/).
I joined ICES in March 2015 working with [Prof. Omar Ghattas](http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~omar) on scalable numerical methods for the solution of Bayesian inverse problems, uncertainty quantification and propagation.<br>
From February 2013 to February 2015, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC)](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/) of
[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)](https://llnl.gov/), working with [Dr. Panayot Vassilevski](http://people.llnl.gov/vassilevski1) on algebraic multigrid and numerical upscaling techniques with applications to flow in porous media.<br>
In December 2012, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics with specialization in Computational Mathematics (high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, image processing,
inverse problems, and numerical analysis) from [Emory University](http://emory.edu/), with [Prof. Alessandro Veneziani](http://mathcs.emory.edu/~ale)
([Dept. of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/)) serving as my principal advisor.
