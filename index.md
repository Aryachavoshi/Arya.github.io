I obtained my Bachelor's in Civil, and Environmental Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://www.sharif.edu) in August 2021. During my undergraduate degree, I developed a forward uncertainty quantification framework by coupling Monte-Carlo sampling with stochastic time series generation to obtain a probabilistic estimation of the Lake Urmia- groundwater interaction. I published this project in the Journal of Hydrology (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216942200453X) under the supervision of [Dr. Mohammad Danesh-Yazdi](http://sina.sharif.edu/~danesh/)([Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering]).

I started my PhD in the department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering in the University of Texas at Austin (href="https://www.caee.utexas.edu) under the supervision of Prof. Dev Niyogi (https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/researcher/dev_niyogi/).I am interested in applying Deep Learning-based compueter vision algorithms to statistically downscale the future climate projections of precipitation, and temperature over urban regions. Also, I am interested in utilizing Bayesian-based statistical methods to quantify the uncertainty in hydroclimate variables. <br><br>
