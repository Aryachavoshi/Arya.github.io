## Research highlights
My interests are directed towards mathematical modeling of physical phenomena and numerical simulations with relevance to engineering
based problems.
My research areas of expertise are in numerical analysis, finite element methods, algebraic multigrid solvers and preconditioners,
numerical upscaling for porous media flow, multilevel methods for uncertainty quantification, computational fluid dynamics,
and PDE-constrained optimization.

As a research associate at ICES, I am working on advanced parallel numerical algorithms for large-scale inverse problems,
uncertainty quantification, and optimization under uncertainty.
In addition, I am interested in applying multilevel techniques to the solution of stochastic partial differential equations,
including Multilevel Monte-Carlo and hierarchical sampling of spatially correlated random fields.
